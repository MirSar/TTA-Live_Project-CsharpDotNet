# TTA - Live Project - C# and Entity Framework
## Introduction 
The Tech Academy's live python project is held during the final two weeks of the course.  The live project is divided into two week long sprints.  Each member of the team was given two weeks to contribute to the ongoing development of an ongoing project.
This project is built using ASP .NET MVC and Entity Framework. This project is the interactive website for managing the content and productions for a theater/acting company.

Each developer contributes to the overall project by completing assigned project cards/stories.  My contribution was to build the rental request portion of an interactive website for a fictatious Theatre/acting company, Theatre Vertigo.

Below is the code summary of my project, along with code snippets and navigation links.

## Back End Stories
### Azure DevOps
Become familiar with using Azure DevOps software to be an effective team member of a larger ongoing project.

### Create model and CRUD pages
Created an entity model for the Rental Request class so that Rental Requests can be saved to the database. This task/story consisted of two parts: I first created a model and then I created the necessary CRUD pages for it.

### Third BackEnd Story
Rental Request Index Page 
Part 1: Create an accordion to display all the rental requests. On the extreme right of the bar, the time remaining on the rental should be displayed. If the rental has not started as yet, it should display the time until the rental starts. 

### Fourth BackEnd Story
Rental Request Index Page 
Part 2: Sort rental requests and hide expired rental requests. There are multiple parts to this story. We would like to sort the rental requests by date and we would also like the user to be able to toggle between current rental requests and expired rental requests
